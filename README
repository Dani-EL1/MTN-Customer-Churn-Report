# 📊 MTN Nigeria Customer Churn Intelligence Report – Q1 2025 (Recreated)

## 🧭 Overview

This project is a full **recreation** of an MTN Nigeria Customer Churn Analysis originally by Oluwademilade Adeniyi.

Inspired by that work, I used Excel to build an interactive dashboard and conducted exploratory churn analysis using synthetic customer data based on real-world MTN Nigeria plans and devices.

The final result includes a clean dashboard, key insights, a comprehensive report, and actionable recommendations.
